                <p>Royal Enfield Classic 350 and Classic 500 are models of Royal Enfield motorcycles which have been in
                    production since 2009. The Classic series of Royal Enfield motorcycles are inspired by the Royal
                    Enfield G2 350cc Bullet motorcycle, first produced in 1948.</p>

                <p>This is the Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 and, needless to say, it’s a very popular motorcycle in
                    India. The riders in our country have a deep liking for sporty as well as old-school motorcycles,
                    and the Conti GT delivers both these traits in a stunning package. Although its sales never
                    skyrocketed — mainly due to its sporty ergonomics, the Conti has a small yet religious fan base.
